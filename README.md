# Introduction

This example is about a simple Typescript nodejs module that can be published to [npmjs.org](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) or other NPM registries. It should help you to quickly start a new Typescript project for a resuable module with all important aspects of a project, such as testing, coverage and code analysis.

If you want to start a new nodejs module based on Typescript without a graphical user interface (GUI) then you can simply use this one.
It uses:

* [Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) to write more secure and maintainable Javascript code
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) to make your code more readable using [code formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint)
* [Eslint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESLint) to analyse your code for inconsistencies, bad practices or security issues using [static code analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) to write unit tests for your module
* [Istanbul NYC](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) to calculate how much of your module code is [covered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) by unit tests

# Clean

In order to clean all build outputs (dist, coverage etc.) you need to run

```
npm run clean
```
# Code formatting
It is important to have readable code and ensure a consisting read experience accross the code base - even if written by different team members.
You can automatically format all your code by running
```
npm run fmt
```

You can define which files should be ignored by this in [.prettierignore](.prrettierignore). It is often very similar to your .gitignore.

You can configure the code formatting in [.prettierrc.json](.prettierrc.json).

# Build

To build the module run

```
npm run build
```

You will will find all built code in the dist folder

# Build for production
Production builds are more compact and do not contain unnecessary files.
You can build a production build using
```
npm run build-prod
```
You will will find all built code in the dist folder

# Code analysis

Analysis of the code can be run via

```
npm run codeanalysis
```

If there are issues with your code it will prompt them to you include the line of code and the issue.
You can configure it via the configuration file [.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json)

# Test

Testing can be run via

```
npm run test
```

It will produce a table that shows you a summary of your test coverage of your module. Additionally it will report the following outputs:

- A HTML report in the folder coverage/index.html. You can browse through all code files and see where coverage is still missing
- A [lcov](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lcov) report that can integrated in various code reporting tools, such as [Sonarqube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SonarQube)

It is recommended to store the test results in a versioned manner with your release files, so people can check them.

You can specify your own tests by adding a \*.spec.ts file in the folder spec. See [spec/index.spec.ts](spec/index.spec.ts) for an example.

You can configure testing via [spec/support/jasmin.json](spec/support/jasmine.json).

You can configure coverage via [.nycrc.json](.nycrc.json).

# Continuous Integration Pipeline
We provide a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipeline using [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

The workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml).


You may also look at other continuous integration alternatives, such as [Travis-CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/).
